                Procedure
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <h3>
                    For Making Chenna
                </h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Begin to heat 1 litre milk in a thick bottomed pan. Stir at intervals when the milk begins to get
                    heated.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    When the milk comes to a boil, you will see a layer of malai or clotted cream which forms on top.
                    Remove this layer of malai. You will get about 2 to 3 tablespoons of malai. We will be using this
                    malai to make the sweet filling for cham cham.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Switch off flame when milk comes to rolling boil.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Add 2 tablespoons vinegar or lemon juice. You can even add 1 tablespoon vinegar or lemon juice. The
                    amount to be added will depend on the quality of milk.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Mix very well and let milk curdle.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Wait for 4 to 5 mins and let the heat reduce a bit. Then strain through muslin lined on a top of a
                    bowl or pan.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Bring the edges of the muslin together, straining all the whey. Be careful as both the chenna and
                    whey will be hot.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Rinse the chenna very well in running water. This removes the lemony flavor and tangy taste from the
                    chenna. Then gently queeze the muslin with your hands, so that any extra water is drained from the
                    chenna.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Keep a heavy weighted bowl or mortar-pestle on the chenna for 8 to 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Untie it and transfer to a large plate. Crumble it using hand.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Mash it and knead it until it starts to turn like dough. Stop kneading when it starts to release the
                    fat (your palm will turn greasy).
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Divide it into 10 equal portions. Take each portion and make oval shaped thick pattie (as shown in
                    the picture) from it. The oval shaped patties should not be more than 1 inch as its size will double
                    after boiling in sugar syrup in next step.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    ake a deep pan (or a pressure cooker) and add 1½ cups sugar and 4-cups water in it to make sugar
                    syrup. Heat it over medium flame and stir to dissolve the sugar. When it comes to rolling boil,
                    gently drop oval shaped patties (one by one) from side of the pan.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Cover it with a lid (if using pressure cooker, remove whistle from the lid and then cover it) and
                    boil for 12-minutes over medium flame. After 6-minutes, open the lid and flip each pattie gently
                    with a spatula. Again, cover with a lid and cook for another 6-minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Turn off the flame and transfer it to a large bowl. Add 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder to it and let
                    it cool to room temperature. Cham Cham is now ready, however, we will make it little more tastier
                    with saffron flavored mawa stuffing. See tips and variation mentioned below for other serving
                    options.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Prepare stuffing for chum chum – take 1/4 cup mawa (khoya), 1 teaspoon powdered sugar, 1/8 teaspoon
                    cardamom powder and dissolved saffron strands in a small bowl.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Mix well using a spoon.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Drain the excess syrup after cham cham cools down to room temperature. It should be cool enough
                    otherwise it may break while stuffing. Take one oval shaped pattie in hand and cut horizontally from
                    one side using a knife, keep another side connected. Take desiccated coconut and pistachio in two
                    different plates.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Gently stuff it with mawa – approx. 1-teaspoon and roll it in desiccated coconut.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Sprinkle pistachio over stuffed mawa and press with hand. Transfer it to the plate and repeat steps
                    11 and 12 for remaining ones.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Bengali cham cham is ready. If you like, you can garnish it with dissolved saffron strands or
                    chopped pistachio. Keep it in a container and place it in refrigerator for 1-2 hours. Serve chilled.
