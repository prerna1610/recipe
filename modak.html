                <h3>
                    To make coconut jaggery filling
                </h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Heat a pan on medium heat and dry roast the coconut for 5 mins to dry out the moisture if any. I've used frozen, thawed coconut. Fresh coconut can be used too.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Add the grated jaggery, mix till it's melted and well combined. Stir in the cardamom powder, saffron, and cashew pieces (optional).
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Keep stirring continuously (approximately 2 mins) until the mixture is almost dry. Turn off the heat and keep it aside to cool slightly. Don't overcook the jaggery coconut filling else it will turn hard. 
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    While the coconut jaggery mixture (also known as saran) cools, let's make the outer covering. 
                </li>
                <h3>
                    To make the outer covering
                </h3>
                <li class="step">
                    In a pot or saucepan, water, add salt and 1 teaspoon of ghee. Bring it to a boil. 
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Stir in the rice flour and mix well using a spoon or spatula. The mixture should be soft, lumpy, and crumbly. Turn off the heat. Cover the pot and let this mixture sit for 5 mins. 
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Transfer the rice flour mixture to a plate and allow it to cool a bit enough to handle but still warm.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Knead the dough for 5 mins using 1-2 tablespoon water (or as needed) and 1-2 teaspoon ghee into a smooth, soft dough.  It shouldn’t be cracked or crumbly.  Keep covered at all times with a wet cloth to prevent it from drying. 
                </li>
                <h3>Making sandesh sweet</h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Divide dough and filling equal portions.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    You can either make modak freehand or using molds. There are two types of mold available aluminum ones and plastic. I've used the aluminum mold.
                </li>
                <h3>
                    To make modak using mold
                </h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Grease your plate or steamer basket.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Open the molds and apply ghee to the inside of the mold. Place one dough ball and close the mold.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    From the open side, start pressing and spreading the dough using fingers as thin as possibly can but not too thin. The excess dough will come out of the mold, either cut it or leave it there. It can be used to close the modak.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Place a portion of the filling in the hollow and use the excess covering to close the modak. Remove any excess dough that you see on the joints of the mold.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Open the modak mold place them in the steamer basket.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Slowly open the mold and remove the modak gently. Place it on a greased steamer basket.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Optional Step : Add 1-2 threads of saffron on top of each modak. (optional step)
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Continue making the remaining modak in a similar manner. Ensure to grease your mold before making the next modak.
                </li>
                <h3>
                    To make modak freehand(without mold)
                </h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Take one ball and starting in the center start flattening and spreading it in disc or bowl as thin as you can without breaking it.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Place the filling in it and make pleats. Bring all edges together and then join them. Remove the extra covering and shape the top to a point (peak). Place in the greased steamer basket.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    You can steam the modak in a pressure cooker or in Instant pot or on the stovetop. Steam in multiple batches depending on how many modak the steamer basket can hold. Do not overcrowd. I did 7-8 at a time.
