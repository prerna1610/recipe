                Procedure
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li class="step">
                    Add whole milk (we are using 1.5 liters/6 cups milk here) to a heavy bottom pot on medium heat.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Once it becomes little warm, take 1-2 tablespoons of milk from the pot and add it to a separate
                    bowl/container. Now take a pinch of saffron strands, crush between you palm and add it to the warm
                    milk. Set aside.
                    Meanwhile add nuts to a pan of water and let it heat up. Let the nuts remain in hot water for 15
                    minutes while you are working on the recipe. And once 15 minutes are up, then remove the skin and
                    chop or slice the nuts. I have used only almonds here, you can use cashews, pistachios etc.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Back to the milk now, let the milk come to a gentle boil. And once it has come to a boil, reduce the
                    heat to medium-low.
                    Let the milk simmer on low heat, do not stir and after 5 minutes or so you will notice that layer of
                    cream starts forming on top of the milk. With a spatula or spoon, pick this cream top and stick it
                    to the sides of the pan. You can then give a gentle stir to the milk and then let it simmer again.

                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Keep doing this process of collecting the cream top and sticking it to the sides as the milk
                    simmers. Do this every 10 minutes or so when the cream forms, and do not stir it in between. Because
                    if you stir then the cream top won't form.
                    On another note- if you want a smooth rabdi, then keep stirring the milk often and don't do this
                    step of sticking the cream on the sides.

                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    After around 35 minutes (from the time it came to a boil), the milk has reduced to half (3 cups). At
                    this point add in the sugar and mix.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Also add the prepared saffron milk that we had prepared earlier. Stir and continue to simmer the
                    milk and collect the cream top on the sides.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    After additional 30-40 minutes, the milk has now reduced to 1/3rd of it's original volume (total
                    time taken from the point it started boiling to reach this stage was 1 hour 20 minutes). At this
                    point add chopped nuts.Also add cardamom powder and rose water and stir.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Now scrape all the malai (cream) from the sides using a spatula that you had collected all this
                    while and mix it with the reduced milk.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Remove pot from heat and rabdi is now ready. As you can see the final volume of the rabdi was 2 cups
                    (we started with 6 cups). If you want, you can even reduce it further to 1/4th of it's original
                    volume which will be 1.5 cups.
                    Chill the rabdi and garnish with more nuts before serving!
