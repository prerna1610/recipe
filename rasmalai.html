            <ul>
                <h3>For the saffron flavoured milk</h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Boil the milk in a deep non-stick pan on a high flame, while stirring twice in between. This will
                    take approx. 4 to 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Reduce the flame to medium and cook for 15 minutes or till the milk reduces to half its quantity,
                    while stirring occasionally and scraping the sides of the pan.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Meanwhile, combine the saffron and warm milk in a small bowl or mortar-pestle (khalbhatta), mix well
                    and keep aside.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Add the sugar to the boiling milk, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 1 minute.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Switch off the flame, add the saffron-milk mixture and cardamom powder and mix well.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Keep aside to cool for 30 minutes and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. .
                </li>
                <h3>For the rasgulla</h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Boil the milk in a deep non-stick pan on a high flame, while stirring twice in between. This will
                    take approx. 4 to 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Now, put 5 cups of water in a steamer or a pressure cooker and add the sugar and bring it to a boil,
                    while stirring occasionally so that the suggar dissolves completely.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Switch of the flame, add the lemon juice gradually and keep stirring gently till it curdles. It is
                    completely curdled, when the paneer and the whey (greenish water) separate out.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Strain using a muslin cloth. Discard or store the whey.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Place the muslin cloth with the paneer in a bowl of fresh water and mash it gently for 1 to 2
                    minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Repeat step 4 two more times by changing the water in the bowl each time.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Tie and hang it for 30 minutes for the extra water to drain out.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Squeeze the muslin cloth to drain any more water remaining. Place the muslin cloth on a flat plate,
                    open it and knead the paneer very well using your palms for 3 to 4 minutes or till the paneer is
                    smooth and free of lumps.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Divide the paneer into 10 equal portions and roll each portion into a small ball between your palms
                    and flatten it lightly and gently. Keep aside.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Put 5 cups of water in a steamer, add the sugar and bring to boil, while stirring occasionally so
                    that the sugar dissolves completely.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Put the paneer balls into the sugar water and steam for 7 to 8 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Switch off the flame and allow it to stand in the steamer for 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <h3>How to proceed</h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Remove the rasgulla one by one from the sugar syrup, squeeze them gently in between your palms and
                    add them to the saffron flavoured milk and stir gently.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Refrigerate them for at least 30 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Serve chilled garnished with pistachios and almonds.
