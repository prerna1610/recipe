                Procedure
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <h3>
                    For Cover
                </h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Take 1 cup maida and 1½ tablespoons ghee in a bowl having wide mouth.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Mix ghee and maida really well using your hands for at least a minute. The mixture will look crumbly
                    as shown in the photo. This step is necessary to make the crispy outer layer.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Add water as needed and knead stiff dough (stiffer than paratha dough). Cover it with a moist muslin
                    cloth and keep aside for 15-20 minutes.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    While the dough is resting, let’s make the stuffing.
                </li>
                <h3>
                    Directions for Stuffing
                </h3>
                <li class="step">
                    You can use either mawa or milk powder to make the stuffing according to the availability.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    If you are using the khoya/mawa: If you are using the frozen or refrigerated mawa, bring it at room
                    temperature. Add mawa/khoya in a small pan and heat it over low flame.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Stir and cook the mawa for around 2-3 minutes or until it releases the little fat over medium flame.
                    Don’t cook it for longer time.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Turn off the flame and transfer the roasted mawa to a plate. Let it cool at room temperature until
                    it is little warm.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    When it comes to a boil, add milk powder little by little. Stir continuously to mix well.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Stir and cook until mixture turns thick and turns into a big lump
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Transfer it to a plate/bowl and let it cool at room temperature.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    When the mawa/milk powder mixture turns cool or little warm, add dry grated coconut/desiccated
                    coconut and chopped mixed nuts (almonds, cashews and raisins) and mix it well.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Add cardamom powder and powdered sugar. (Don’t add sugar while the mawa mixture is hot, otherwise
                    sugar melts and mixture will turn runny).Mix well. Stuffing is ready. It should be little moist.
                </li>
                <h3>
                    Shape the Gujiya/Ghughara/Karanji
                </h3>
                <li class="step">
                    Knead the dough again for a minute and divide it into two equal portions. Take each portion and give
                    a shape like long cylindrical roll. Cut each into 6-7 equal portions. Make a round shaped ball from
                    each portion. (Keep the dough/dough balls/raw gujiyas covered all the time with moist cloth to
                    prevent them from drying.)
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Take one ball and press it a little on rolling board. Roll it out into a 3-inch diameter circle like
                    puri.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    You can shape the gujiyas in two different ways- 1.using mould and 2. without using mould
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    Make all the gujiyas and cover them with a damp cloth. Heat oil in frying pan over medium flame.
                    When oil is medium hot, add 3-4 gujiyas at a time. Deep fry them until light golden brown and crispy
                    over low-medium flame.
                </li>
                <li class="step">
                    It will take around 4-5 minutes to deep fry each batch. Drain excess oil with slotted spoon and
                    transfer over kitchen paper to a plate. Gujiyas are ready. When they cool down completely, store
                    them in an airtight container and consume within 5-7 days.
